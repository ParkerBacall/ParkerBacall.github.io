<p class="info"> I am a current senior at The University of Denver working towards my bachelor of The arts in Emergent Digital Practices along with a minor in studio art. From a young age my greatest interests were in exploration. I am continuously inspired by the unknown, and have been working towards artistic proficiency through digital mediums such as; coding, animation, 3d modeling, graphic design, and video/projection art.
